# 📦 BookHive PHPUnit Test Suite

This directory contains unit tests for the core and optional functionalities of the **BookHive** virtual library platform.

Each test uses **PHPUnit** to validate functionality and ensure reliability of database interactions.

## ✅ Core Tests

### `SignupTest.php`
- Verifies that a new user can successfully register
- Uses a unique email/username combo
- Checks that the user is inserted and gets a valid `user_id`

### `SigninTest.php`
- Confirms login behavior using known credentials
- Hashes the password and checks with `password_verify`
- Validates session-like authentication behavior

### `ThreadTest.php`
- Tests thread creation using a valid test user
- Verifies insertion into the `threads` table

## 🧪 Optional / Bonus Tests

### `ProfileTest.php`
- Tests updating a user's email address
- Confirms the update was successful in the database

### `AddBookTest.php`
- Tests insertion of a book record into the `books` table
- Assumes `title`, `author`, and `user_id` fields

### `AdminTest.php`

## 🧪 Running the Tests

To run all tests:
```bash
phpunit
```

Make sure you have:
- A valid database connection (via `connect.php`)
- PHPUnit installed (`composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit`)
- Tables created via SQL scripts (`create_users.sql`, `create_threads.sql`, etc.)

---

## 📌 Note
These tests use transactions and rollback to prevent polluting your database.
Ensure you are connected to a **test database** when running.
