# ðŸ“¦ BookHive PHPUnit Test Suite

This directory contains unit tests for the core and optional functionalities of the **BookHive** virtual library platform.

Each test uses **PHPUnit** to validate functionality and ensure reliability of database interactions.

## ðŸ§ª Running the Tests

To run all tests:
```bash
phpunit
```

Make sure you have:
- A valid database connection (via `connect.php`)
- PHPUnit installed (`composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit`)
- Tables created via SQL scripts (`create_users.sql`, `create_threads.sql`, etc.)

## ðŸ“Œ Note
These tests use transactions and rollback to prevent polluting your database.
Ensure you are connected to a **test database** when running.
